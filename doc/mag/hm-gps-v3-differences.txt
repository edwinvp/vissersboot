The original boat works with a round GPS/compass board called "HM GPS v2.0".
This is the circuit board that the original boat was tested with.

But meanwhile the owner has bought a new GPS-receiver.
The PCB now says "HM GPS V3.0" instead of the original "HM GPS V2.0".
With this new PCB the boat doesn't work.

After a bit of debugging, turns out the GPS still works,
but the e-compass chip gives zero readings.

Also it appears they have changed the compass chip on the board.

Because the chip on V2 board says:
A983
2435

While the chip on V3 board reads:
7280
010

As you can see this is clearly another chip!

Since I don't know which chip the new one is, I can't tell if it ought to be compatible.

2019-05-15 UPDATE:

Made a scan of the I2C bus

The following addresses answered:
addr 29       0x1d (the new type of compass?)
addr 133      0x85 (m8n gps)
addr 161      0xa1 (eeprom)

All these addresses are x2.
So the real address is 0x0E.
Search on the internet reveals this could be the:
NXP Xtrinsic MAG3110 Three-Axis, Digital Magnetometer

Tried to read the registers of MAG3310.
Get weird output that doesn't agree with the register descriptions:

For instance register 0x7 (who am I) should contain 0xc4 but instead it stays at 0.

Some other regs:
r[0]=16
r[1]=255
r[2]=0
r[3]=0
r[4]=0
r[5]=0
r[6]=0
r[7]=0
r[8]=0
r[9]=0
r[10]=0
r[11]=12
r[12]=0
r[13]=0
r[14]=255
r[15]=255
r[16]=255
r[17]=255
r[18]=255
r[19]=255
r[20]=255
r[21]=255
r[22]=255
r[23]=255
r[24]=255
r[25]=255
r[26]=255
...

Maybe the chip is actually an IST8303 or IST8310

Update: YES it is the IST8310, its datasheet talks about a "who am I" register at index 0 which should read 0x10 (we read 16 decimal so that matches!).
