The original boat works with a round GPS/compass board called "HM GPS v2.0".
This is the circuit board that the original boat was tested with.

But meanwhile the owner has bought a new GPS-receiver.
The PCB now says "HM GPS V3.0" instead of the original "HM GPS V2.0".
With this new PCB the boat doesn't work.

After a bit of debugging, turns out the GPS still works,
but the e-compass chip gives zero readings.

Also it appears they have changed the compass chip on the board.

Because the chip on V2 board says:
A983
2435

While the chip on V3 board reads:
7280
010

As you can see this is clearly another chip!

Since I don't know which chip the new one is, I can't tell if it ought to be compatible.
